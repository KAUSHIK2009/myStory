a cap seller walking in the jungle rests for a while as he is tired and the
monkeys in the jungle take all his caps to imitate him. When he wakes 
and sees the monkeys he tries to take back his caps but the monkeys won'tgive them back. He understands the goal of the monkeys and he puts
his cap in his bag and the monkeys trying to imitate him also do the
same thing and he gets his caps back.
